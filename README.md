# Controlling-servomotor-with-information-from-Ultrasonicsensor-on-RPi-4
-In this repo I have tried to demonstrate how we can use distance information from the ultrasonic sensor to control the servomotor.
-This method is only for understanding working of all the components used such as ultrasonic sensor, servomotor and the GPIO pins of RasberryPi board.
-I have used a linear relation between dutycycle and distance and used it in the python code.
